### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- Y8.com. Yes, it does exist until now though some games are not accessible anymore. 

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- I'd like to build a website that would act as a virtual secretary. As you input some tasks that you need to do, there would already be suggestions for needed other sites and if it is already urgent and you still haven't done the task, it has the permission to do it for you. Lol. That would be done with the help of AI. Haha.

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- Aside from large successful companies such as Google, Microsoft, etc., I'd like to work for private companies.

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- Hoping to have a project with you guys, soon!
