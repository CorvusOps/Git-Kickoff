### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- `The first ever website I visited was probably Facebook. I remember playing Tetris with my friends at that time, and we were trash-talking each other out about who was the best player. Facebook still works today, but sadly, games like Tetris can't be played anymore.`

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- `Someday, I want to build a web app that helps travelers reach their destinations and gives them the best possible and easiest routes. I want to help them pick the best tourist spot possible based on their location.`

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- `Any big companies like Google, IBM, Amazon.`

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- `I don't have much experience at Github, so I think any projects that will make us enhance our skills at Git.`
