### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?

- `The first website I visited was probably Yahoo.com. Yes, it still exists today. The website has the same feel like back in the day but with a more modern design.`

### Describe the website you want to build someday

- `I want to build a website that allows learners of all ages to assess themselves to find out which career or career path is suited for them, to show all available scholarships for a certain career, and so on. The basic gist of it is that it provides a platform for learners who need help :)`

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?

- `Any company in FAANG would be lucky to have me`
