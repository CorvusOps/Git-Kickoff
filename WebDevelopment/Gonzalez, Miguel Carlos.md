### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- `I think the first website I have visited was either miniclip.com or y8... Both still exist, but it looked so much worse when I first visited.`

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- `A website that I would want to build is probably something along the lines of an e-commerce website and a portfolio website as well.`

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- `At the moment, it would be a long-shot but if there was one, it would probably be Google. It just seems funs to work there I guess...`

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- `I want to learn more about Web Development, and Web3 as well! `
