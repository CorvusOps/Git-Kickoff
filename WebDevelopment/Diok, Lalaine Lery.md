### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- It was Friendster! Sadly it has then been shut down around 2015 and has been bought off to be a gaming website the last time I checked. 

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- A website with many interactable features. Though if something I could call myself, either a social media focused for different forms of art(digital art, tradional art, music making, dancing, etc.), or a School or University club/organization sharing platform or Application!   

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- I've heard of companies like DXC Technology and Accenture through some webinar. Though, I'm not aiming that big yet rather, I'd let opportunities reach through me. A possible company also is a company an old friend who works for called 'Symph', I aim to go there one day.

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- Beside a complete procedure of Web Development, maybe tackling WordPress or othe technologies that could be mixed through Web Development.
