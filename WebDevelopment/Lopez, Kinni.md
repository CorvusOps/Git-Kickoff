### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- `I can't remember... Maybe it was YouTube? Anyway, the website changed a LOT. I personally miss the old and quirky YT where youtubers could personalize their channel's background. However, the layout changed for the best.`

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- `I want to build something that is niche yet useful for people to visit it often.`

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- `Definitely not in FAANG. Kidding aside, I'm interested in working at a startup company because of its work culture and (rapid) internal career growth.`

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- `Job interview prep! Maybe a roadmap on how to prepare for coding interviews? I've (partly) read the book called "Cracking the Code interview" a while back and I want to know the thoughts of the team about it (especially on this specific page: https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*1ZSd44DpQXM92qJ1F47ngQ.webp). The thought of creating projects while sharpening your skills in data structures and algorithms at the same time is quite intimidating...`
